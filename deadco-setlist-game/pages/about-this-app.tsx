          <h2>The Story Behind Setlist Street</h2>
          <p>
            This app was created for fun by a Dead and Company fan and Engineering PhD who has 
            attended 25+ shows and was born out of a nerdy fascination with guessing D&C setlists 
            and desire to analyze which songs are played together most often.

          <h2>How It All Started</h2>
          <p>
            This is the first debut. It was hacked together in 3 days before the G60 concerts.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a personal obsession with predicting what songs would be played at 
            Dead & Company shows turned into this full-featured platform for fellow Deadheads 
            to test their knowledge and compete with each other.

          <h2>The Vision</h2>
          <p>
            If you like this app and want to see it for future D&C shows or other bands feel 
            free to like our social media page and leave a comment!
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to create the ultimate platform for music fans to engage with their 
            favorite bands' live performances in a new and exciting way. What started with 
            Dead & Company could expand to other jam bands and artists.
