Main Content

This app was created for fun by a Dead and Company fan and Engineering PhD who has attended 25+ shows and was born out of a nerdy fascination with guessing D&C setlists and desire to analyze which songs are played together most often.
This is the first debut. It was hacked together in 3 days before the G60 concerts.
If you like this app and want to see it for future D&C shows or other bands feel free to like our social media page and leave a comment!
For game ideas, comments or future collaboration ideas feel free to email setliststreet@proton.me.
